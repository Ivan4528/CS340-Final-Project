When developing the CRUD Python module in Project One, I focused on clear class design, consistent naming, inline comments, and exception handling.
By creating a reusable AnimalShelter class with separate create, read, update, and delete methods, I ensured the code could easily be maintained or extended later.

For this project, I broke the requirements into smaller parts: first loading and verifying the MongoDB data, then building the CRUD module, and finally creating the Dash dashboard with interactive widgets.
My approach was to follow the MVC pattern: the model (MongoDB database), the controller (CRUD Python module), and the view (Dash dashboard). Compared to previous assignments, this project required more focus on integrating multiple technologies and thinking about the end user experience

Computer scientists design solutions to real problems by applying computational methods. In this project, my work helps Grazioso Salvare quickly identify dogs that are best suited for specific rescue training scenarios.
This saves the organization time and resources while increasing the chances of successful rescue outcomes. More broadly, computer scientists improve efficiency, decision making, and innovation in organizations.
